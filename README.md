# Simon-Says-Game

Welcome to my project repository. This project is a digital adaptation of the classic memory game "Simon Says", where players must remember and repeat increasingly complex sequences of colors. This project aims to provide an engaging and interactive experience.

Here all the necessary files are available to the complete game - a HTML file, a CSS file and a Javascript file.
Various methods and funtionalities of javascript like arrow function, event listener, query selector, setTimeout function are used to build the project.
